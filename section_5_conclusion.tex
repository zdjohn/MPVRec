\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this paper we propose MERec, a novel approach that can effectively predict newly emerged item/user when there is little or no interaction data available. It has a wide application in real-world recommendation tasks, such as job, real-estate, where cold-start is a common problem. 
While MERec allows user to define meta-path settings in terms of controlling random walk process, it also opens up possible enhancement on learning different weights automatically across multiple meta-path with in the HIN. Making the embedding inductive instead of transitive is another interesting topic worthy exploring.
