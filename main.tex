\begin{abstract}
Recommender System has been widely adopted in real-world applications. Collaborative Filtering (CF) and matrix based approach has been the forefront for the past decade in both implicit and explicit recommendation tasks. One prominent challenge most recommendation approach facing is dealing with different data quality and conditions. i.e. cold start and data sparsity. Some model based CF methods condense user/item data into latent space to overcome sparsity problem. However, when dealing with constant cold start problem, CF approach can be ineffective and costly. In this paper, we propose MERec, a novel approach that adopts graph meta-path embedding to learn item/user features independently besides learning from user-item interactions. Such approach allows unseen data to be incorporated as part of user/item learning process, hence effectively reduce the impact in cold start problem for new or sparse dataset.

% The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
% an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
% G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
% acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.
